# --:: Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators ( +, -, *, /, %, //, **)
# Assignment operators (=, +=)
# Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)

# Logical operators (and, or, not)
# Identity operators (is, is not, )
# Membership operators (in, not in)
# Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>)

# print(abs(-12.12))

# print(round(3.75))
# print(round(3.15))
# print(round(3.16, 1)) #round digit
