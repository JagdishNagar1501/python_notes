***   What is an Array?   ***
Ans:-   An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

***   Access the Elements of an Array  ***
    You refer to an array element by referring to the index number.

Example:-
    cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
    x = cars[0]
    print(x)

Example:-
    cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
    cars[0] = "Toyota"
    print(cars)

    
***   The Length of an Array   ***
    Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in an array).

Example:-
    Return the number of elements in the cars array:
        cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]        
        x = len(cars)
        print(x)

***   Looping Array Elements   ***
    You can use the for in loop to loop through all the elements of an array.

Example:-
    Print each item in the cars array:
    
    cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
    for x in cars:
    print(x)

    
***   Adding Array Elements   ***
    You can use the append() method to add an element to an array.

Example:-
    Add one more element to the cars array:

    cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
    cars.append("Honda")
    print(cars)

***   Removing Array Elements   ***
    You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array.

Example:-
    Delete the second element of the cars array:

    cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
    cars.pop(1)
    print(cars)

    You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array.

Example:-
    Delete the element that has the value "Volvo":

    cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
    cars.remove("Volvo")
    print(cars)
